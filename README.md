# Well-to-Seismic-Tie
### Steps for Seismic-Well Tying Process

Seismic-well tying is essential for integrating well log data with seismic data, ensuring accurate alignment of geological features in the time domain. Below are the detailed steps to include in a README file:

---

### **1. Prepare Well Log Data**
- Gather well log data such as:
  - **Acoustic Impedance (AI):** Computed as AI = Velocity × Density.
  - **Sonic Log (DT):** Provides interval transit time (Δt) for velocity calculation.
  - **Density Log (ρ):** Used to calculate AI.
- Ensure the well logs are clean (no NaN or erroneous values).

---

### **2. Convert Well Log Depth to Two-Way Travel Time (TWT)**
- Convert the well logs from the depth domain to the time domain using the velocity model

---

### **3. Generate Reflectivity Coefficient (RC) Series**
- Compute the reflectivity \( R_C \) from the acoustic impedance \( AI \):
 
- The reflectivity represents changes in acoustic properties at geological boundaries.

---

### **4. Create a Synthetic Seismogram**
- Select a seismic wavelet (e.g., Ricker wavelet) matching the seismic data's frequency content.
- Convolve the reflectivity series with the wavelet to create a synthetic seismogram
  This simulates the seismic response at the well location.

---

### **5. Align the Synthetic Seismogram with the Seismic Data**
- Extract seismic traces near the well location from the seismic section.
- Match the synthetic seismogram with the seismic data by:
  - Adjusting for time shifts (e.g., using cross-correlation).
  - Scaling amplitude for better visual alignment.

---

### **6. Validate the Tie**
- Check the alignment of:
  - Reflectors in the synthetic with seismic events.
  - Geological markers (formation tops, reservoirs) with seismic features.
- Use well tops or known formation depths to ensure accuracy.

---

### **7. Finalize and Save Results**
- Save the tied synthetic seismogram and well log in the seismic time domain.
- Document adjustments made (e.g., time shifts, scaling factors).
- Include visualizations (plots of synthetic vs. seismic) for reference.

---

### **Tools/Software Used**
- **Python Packages:**
  - `NumPy` for mathematical operations.
  - `Matplotlib` for plotting.
  - `SciPy` for interpolation and convolution.
- **Additional Software:** SEG-Y readers (e.g., `segyio`) for seismic data handling.

---

### **Example Workflow**
1. Read well log data (`df5`).
2. Compute Acoustic Impedance (if not available).
3. Convert well log depth to TWT.
4. Generate synthetic seismogram using a Ricker wavelet.
5. Extract seismic data near the well and match it with the synthetic.
6. Plot and verify the tie visually.

By following these steps, you can create a robust seismic-well tie to enhance geological interpretation.
